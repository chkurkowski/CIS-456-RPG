# CIS-456-RPG

This is the repository for our Action Adventure RPG in our CIS 456 course.

The game will be similar to Diablo style games with a click to move system and a upgrade system of some kind. 

The game will be developed in Unity over the course of a single semester between myself(Chase) and another classmate(Austin).

All of this is subject to change.
